    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "## **Answer**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Random Forest\n",
    "Real world applications: Predict parts failures in manufacturing – Data mining\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tThey perform well even in the presence of a large number of features and a small number of observations.\n",
    "2.\tQuick Prediction/Training Speed\n",
    "3.\tRobust to Outliers\n",
    "4.\tAbility to measure variable importance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tModel interpretability: Random forest models are not all that interpretable; they are like black boxes.\n",
    "2.\tFor very large data sets, the size of the trees can take up a lot of memory.\n",
    "3.\tIt can tend to overfit, but that can be mitigated by tuning the hyperparameters\n",
    "4.\tDoes not perform well when there is a diagonal decision boundary as it will take an ordinary random forest model many splits to describe that diagonal boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest is very fast to train, and Since the data set is large (36177 rows for training data) having a model that is fast to train is a huge advantage, especially when using random search or grid search to find the optimal hyperparameters. Fast training combined with being okay with handling large number of features makes Random forest a good candidate\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Logistic Regression\n",
    "Real world applications: Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), which is widely used to predict mortality in injured patient\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tdoes not require too many computational resources\n",
    "2.\tdoesn’t require input features to be scaled\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvanages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tcan’t solve non-linear problems with logistic regression since its decision surface is linear.\n",
    "2.\tLogistic regression will not perform well with independent variables that are not correlated to the target variable and are very similar or correlated to each other.\n",
    "3.\tLogistic Regression is also not one of the most powerful algorithms out there and can be easily outperformed by more complex ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have a single dependent variable and it is also binary, Logistic regression would be a good candidate, it also has the analytical advantage of providing us with the probability of a certain event happening, so not just the binary outcome\n",

    "real world application: product recommendation for online shopping\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tvery flexible, can be combined with any other machine learning classifier to boost its performance\n",
    "2.  Very robust to overfitting\n",
    "3.  works well with large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  vulnerable to uniform noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost iteratively corrects the mistakes of the weak classifier and improves accuracy by combining weak learners, meaning we can select a classifier suitable for our data and boost its results. We can use a decision tree as our classifier without worrying too much about overfitting, its also applicable for continuous and categorical inputs, our data is a combination of both.\n",

    "Adaboost is the best model. the model yielded the best F-score, and even though it is much slower than the other models in regards to training and prediction time, it has the advantage of having less hyper-parameters which will drastically reduce the time to find the best parameters using grid search or random search. prediction time is irrelevant since our model doesn't need to work in real time. Adaboost is suitable for both continuous and categorical data, and our data happen to be a mix of both. adaboost also works well with large data sets, and we have 36177 samples in the training data set, which is significantly large."

    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost works by training a large number of learners called 'weak learners', each one of these weak learners is responsible for solving a small section of the classification problem, meaning it is useful at classifying a specific set of data. each weak learner gets assigned a weight that will depend on its accuracy, and the weight determines how much the weak learner affects the decision we make regarding the classficiation. adaboost works by combining the decisions of all these weak learners which produces a strong learner that is able to classify the data with high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**what is a weak learner?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A weak learner is a machine learning algorithm that is able to correctly classify the data with accuracy slightly more than 50%. The higher the accuracy, the better the weak learner. If the accuracy is 50% it means the weak learner is just randomly guessing, and random guessing doesn't help us to classify the data correctly, so we assign a weight of zero to these weak learners, negating their effect on the outcome. If a weak learner has low accuracy (<50%), It still gives us useful information. for example, if a weak learner always makes the wrong prediction, then doing the opposit of what it says resulting in always making the correct prediction. in most cases the weak learner used for boosting is a decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**what is a decision tree?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree is like a tree that is drawn upside down, with its root at the top. the root gets split into 2 branches based on a condition we put, and these branches get split into other branches, at the end there is a leaf which translates one of the classes we are trying to classify.\n",

    "\n",
    "**why decision trees are used as weak learners?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decision trees are non-linear. Boosting with linear models simply doesn't work well because the data is most often not linearly seperable\n",
    "2. The weak learner needs to be consistently better than random guessing, and we don't normaly need to do any parameter tuning to a decision tree to get that behavior.\n",
    "3. Decision trees are reasonably fast to train. Since we are going to be building 100s or 1000s of them, thats a good property. They are also fast to classify, meaning they predict the outcome of new input quickly.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
